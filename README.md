# 🧠 Machine Learning–Based Design Patterns Prediction


## 📌 Project Overview

**Machine Learning–Based Design Patterns Prediction** is an intelligent system designed to analyze source code and predict suitable **software design patterns** using machine learning techniques.

In modern software development, identifying the right design pattern at the right time is critical for building **scalable, maintainable, and reusable systems**.  
This project bridges the gap between **software architecture principles** and **machine learning**, enabling automated pattern recognition from real-world codebases.



## 🎯 Problem Statement

Software design patterns are often:

- Difficult for beginners to identify  
- Time-consuming to analyze manually  
- Misused due to lack of architectural understanding  

As codebases grow larger, manual inspection becomes inefficient and error-prone.



## 💡 Solution Approach

The system follows this workflow:

- Accepts **source code files** as input  
- Extracts meaningful **structural features**  
- Applies **Machine Learning algorithms**  
- Predicts the most suitable **design pattern**  
- Displays results through a **web-based interface**

> **AI supports architectural decisions — it does not replace developers.**



## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend
- Python  
- Django Framework  
- Machine Learning models (classification-based)

### Frontend
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

### Database
- MySQL  



## 📂 Design Patterns Coverage

- Covers **180+ design pattern implementations**
- Includes:
  - **Creational Patterns**
  - **Structural Patterns**
  - **Behavioral Patterns**

Although the dataset contains many patterns, the model focuses on learning **core architectural characteristics** rather than memorizing files.



## 🚀 Real-World Applications

This project can be applied to:

- Code review tools  
- Developer assistance platforms  
- Learning tools for junior developers  
- Software architecture validation systems  
- CI/CD pipelines for early design feedback  



## 📈 Key Learnings

- End-to-end Machine Learning integration  
- Django + ML model deployment  
- Real-world code analysis  
- Software architecture understanding  
- Scalable backend design  



## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Multi-language support  
- IDE plugin integration  
- Advanced ML / Deep Learning models  
- Real-time design feedback  
- Design pattern confidence scoring  



## 📎 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning can enhance software architecture decisions** by assisting developers in identifying suitable design patterns efficiently and accurately.

🧠 Machine Learning–Based Design Patterns Prediction
Project Overview

Machine Learning–Based Design Patterns Prediction is an intelligent system designed to analyze source code and predict suitable software design patterns using machine learning techniques.

In modern software development, identifying the right design pattern at the right time is critical for building scalable, maintainable, and reusable systems. This project bridges the gap between software architecture principles and machine learning, enabling automated pattern recognition from real codebases.

🎯 Problem Statement

Software design patterns are often:

Difficult for beginners to identify

Time-consuming to analyze manually

Misused due to lack of architectural understanding

As codebases grow larger, manual inspection becomes inefficient and error-prone. This project addresses that challenge by using Machine Learning to assist developers in recognizing design patterns automatically.

💡 Solution Approach

The system:

Accepts source code files as input

Extracts meaningful structural features from the code

Applies Machine Learning algorithms to learn recurring architectural patterns

Predicts the most suitable design pattern for the given code

Displays results through a web-based interface

This approach supports decision-making, not replacement — helping developers write better-structured software.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Backend

Python

Django Framework

Machine Learning algorithms (classification-based)

Frontend

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Database

MySQL

Input Data

Source code files (Java-based design pattern implementations)

📂 Dataset & Design Patterns Coverage

The project includes ~180+ design pattern implementations

Patterns belong to major categories:

Creational Patterns

Structural Patterns

Behavioral Patterns

Although the dataset contains many patterns, the system focuses on learning core structural characteristics rather than memorizing files.

Why not all patterns are equally important?

In real-world software development:

A small subset of patterns is used frequently

A larger dataset improves ML model robustness and generalization

Pattern variations help the model learn architectural intent, not just syntax
